# Welcome to RubyFMP #

This is a simple class that I started in early 2008 to view FMP tilemaps.  This is a port of just the tilemap decoding functions provided in the Mappy playback library by Robin Burrows - rburrows@bigfoot.com.

## Downloading ##

You can find the latest version at the [Project Homepage](http://github.com/cajurabi/RubyFMP)

## Running ##

simply type 'ruby RubyFMP.rb' from the command line.

## TODO ##

Need to finish porting the layer and animation decoding routines.

## Project Influence ##

This is an exact port of FMP loading routines from Mappy playback library by Robin Burrows - rburrows@bigfoot.com.
